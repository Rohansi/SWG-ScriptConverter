# SWG-ScriptConverter
In 2015 someone asked me to make a tool to convert the original Star Wars Galaxies server scripts to Java. I believe it resulted in [this project](https://github.com/SWG-Source) as they have the scripts in Java form over there. That seems to be a fork though so it's probably in other places too.

The source they have on [their repo](https://github.com/SWG-Source/dsrc/tree/master/sku.0/sys.server/compiled/game/script) is missing all the fun comments that were in the original scripts. I didn't bother preserving them in the output from this tool.

Also I only got this to the point where you could compile the resulting Java source into class files. There is almost certainly a version out there that has additional fixes to this code.
